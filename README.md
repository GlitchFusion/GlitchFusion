## 🗨️ A Little About Me

I'm **Glitch Fusion** — a developer who enjoys blending **logic, creativity, and curiosity** into everything I build.

I work across **full stack development, game development, cybersecurity, and cloud technologies**, always aiming to create solutions that are not only **efficient and secure**, but also **engaging and human-friendly**.

I’m also a proud **introvert** — I do my best work in calm, focused environments where I can think deeply and build intentionally. I value my **quiet space**, where ideas have room to grow and complex problems can be explored without distraction.

When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me:
- sipping good coffee in a quiet corner ☕  
- listening to music while debugging 🎶  
- recharging in calm, peaceful spaces 🧘‍♂️  
- chasing adrenaline through adventurous sports 🧗‍♂️  
- or writing — ideas, stories, or tech thoughts ✍️  

> As an introvert, I believe focus and curiosity thrive in quiet — that’s where my best ideas are built.

## 🚀 Future Plans

I believe the best way to grow is by **mastering what you already know and expanding from there**. My plan is to:

- **Deepen my full stack expertise** by mastering TypeScript, modern frameworks like Next.js, and scalable, cloud-based architectures.
- **Advance my game development skills**, focusing on multiplayer systems, real-time 3D graphics, and immersive experiences using Unity and Unreal Engine.
- **Level up my cybersecurity knowledge** with practical penetration testing, threat modeling, and cloud security practices to build more secure applications.
- **Strengthen cloud & DevOps skills** by learning infrastructure-as-code, automated deployments, and serverless architectures.
- **Refine visualization and 3D skills**, exploring procedural generation, WebGL, and interactive visual storytelling.
- **Grow as a communicator and creator**, sharing knowledge through technical writing, presentations, and interactive demos.

> My goal is to build a solid foundation from my current skills and **turn every project into a learning opportunity**, creating solutions that are **secure, scalable, and engaging**.
